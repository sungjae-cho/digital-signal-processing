# 1.1.a Introduction to digital signal processing

Signal: Description of the evolution of a physical phenomenon.

Examples of signals
* (physical phenomnon : description)
* weather : temperature
* sound : pressure (in air)
* sound : magnetic deviation (in mic)
* light intensity : gray level on paper

Processing: 

We process singals in two ways:
* Analysis: _Understanding_ the information carried by the signal.
* Synthesis: _Creating_ a signal to contain the given information.

Degree of freedom: Whatever values we can choose or fix.

Key ingredients of the digital paradigm:
* Discrete time
* Discrete amplitude

Discrete time

Discrete models are extremly easy to compute integrals, for example.

Bridging discrete and continuous time representations.

The sampling theorem (1920).

From continuous time to discrete time

Fourier analysis and transform. 

Discrete amplitude

Why discretizing amplitudes is important?
* Small storage
* Short processing time
* Little transmission

Attenuation?

Digital signal processing: Key ideas
* Discretization of time:
  * Samples replace idealized models.
  * Simple math replaces calculus.
* Discretization of values:
  * General-purpose storage: Any signals can be stored in any digital storage.
  * General-purpose processing (CPU): Any signals can be processed by any digital processor.
  * Noise can be controlled. Efficient communication systems.
